            Nature – A beautiful creation of God – provides us with our endless
            necessities and the air we breathe, is also a magnificent and
            soothing trip for our eyes. While standing in the middle of a
            forest, one can feel the fresh breeze flowing past, the sounds of
            birds chirping, the area of trees, fine bamboo, pines, etc. Such as
            the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary situated in North-Eastern
            India, covering an area of 111.19 km2 rainforest.<br />
            Sadly, it’s getting destroyed by greedy organizations while we
            speak. It has been a classic example of ‘Overexploitation of the
            natural Resources’ which has led to a point of inevitable
            destruction.<br />
            “Over-exploitation of Resources is a point of over-using those
            resources to the point that it can’t be replenished.”

          <h3>How is the problem Relevant for the society?</h3>
          <p>
            Dehing Patkai is considered as Amazon of the East. It houses
            Elephants (under the threat of being endangered), Asian leaf turtle
            and King Cobras.<br />
            ‘But Human greed has led to a point of their extinction.’<br />
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>A species is about to be wiped out.</li>
            <li>
              Miners come for coal extraction, illegal coal mining is carried
              out. This has led to a point of degradation of the surrounding
              lands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heavy deforestation is done for Jhum cultivation and tree
              plantations leading to destruction of forest habitats.
            </li>
            <li>
              Miners use huge trucks and vehicles for transporting of coal
              leading to destruction and pollution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to illegal mining taking place, the coal discharges were
              directly thrown into nearly fields which passes through village.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are countless more problems for the society and we could
            merely name obvious few from countless others.

            The question arises: How is coal being mined up to this day, even if
            natural awareness has been raised?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The villagers consider coal as the opium of the masses. Thus many
            homes have coal depots set up in their own compound.<br />
            "Villagers also hire migrant labourers and provide as the first
            chain suppliers."<br />
            The core of the problem needless to say there are opposers of the
            situation, but evil subdues the good.

          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              The government has terminated existing leashes of the companies.
            </li>
            <li>Dehing Patkai is about to be declared a National Park.</li>
            <li>
              Yes, none of those decisions were made without existing pressure
              from various sections of people, meaning there is negligence by
              the higher power.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also illegal mining is still done regardless of the activities of
              people and government.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A point of importance is the involvement of ‘International
            Indigenous People’s Movement for Self Determination and Liberation
            (IPMSDL) headquartered in Philippine who have joined to voice their
            concerns and denouncing India’s Environment Agencies’ project for
            coal mining approval.<br />

          <h3>So After Much Criticism, What Are Our Proposed Solution?</h3>

          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              Our proposed solution is based on our ability to improve the
              <u>security of the area</u> and working towards possible
              <u>Sustainable Development.</u>
            </li>
            <li>
              For a start, we must appoint a blend of people made up of state
              appointed guards and local unemployed people who would want to
              earn some money protecting the forest. They may use drones, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the local reserves are located in a particular are, we can test
              the area for possible vegetation of cacti and other tundra
              vegetation. This will serve two purposes.
            </li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>To keep the miners away possibly from the reserves.</li>
              <li>
                Tundra vegetation is proficient in growing in areas with less
                water and brings a natural balance through transpiration. Since
                the grounds are dried because of the illegal mining, ground
                levels are broken, tundra vegetation would replenish the
                grounds.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <li>
              Databases are to be compiled based on the villagers. If they are
              part of the mining activities, they would have lots of unaccounted
              money. If they are questioned upon them, we would be able to
              access the inner cycle of the illegal mining trades.
            </li>
            <li>
              We would create websites that will be used to find areas with
              those reserves. And it will be available to a country wide basis.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the resources from an area were to be used wisely and up to a
              limit, the problem of degradation will not arise. As such the
              database will be provided to environmental activities and coal
              mining in an area will be estimated to meet this mark, exceeding
              which the companies further grinding for resources will be
              prosecuted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Database and webpages that will track down the usage of coal by
              companies. If they have exceeded a certain limit, e.g. 100 tons of
              a resources, they will be prosecuted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduction of more animals in the reserve. As the circle of life
              continues, carnivores will eat the herbivores for food, and their
              remains will be buried under and be a source of fossil fuels for
              the future. Black Panthers, Leopards, etc. as a security measure,
              as well as an indicator for natural occurrences.

            The Question Arises, Why are Our Proposed Solutions Efficient?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because we plan to save the Habitats and protect its inhabitants to
            maintain a balance of ecology. Also, if we could limit the use of
            resources, we are saving the resources and controlling pollution
            levels.<br />
            The proposed solution has a positive impact on Nature, as our aim is
            to protect the Environment.

          <h3>Are Our Solutions Unique and New?</h3>
          <p>
            We don’t claim for it to be new as a World of 7 Billion people might
            have had those ideas. But we can claim that our objectives if
            implemented will be affective as we are trying to indicate the
            problems on the base level.<br />
            <u>Our Objectives</u> are to protect the reserves and protection of
            the habitats. Also we look forward to identifying the chief offender
            of the society.<br />
            <u>Our Goals</u> are to obtain an Environment free of destruction
            because of Human Greed. The milestone for the above will be a point
            where Dehing Patkai reserves won’t have illegal activities.

          <h3>Our Stepwise Planning and Execution Strategy</h3>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Gram Panchayats are to be made aware about our plan to appoint
              people who are willing to work with the established guards for
              extra protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information, income sources, recorded wealth, etc. of people of
              surrounding villages are to be accounted on our database.
              Unaccounted money will be questioned upon and they will be
              accordingly prosecuted if they are not able to provide the income
              sources. As unaccounted money is a result of illegal activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Websites, in accordance with activist groups are to be launched,
              only accessible to special individuals like scientists who would
              estimate resource reserves. The data will be provided to the
              government who would have to estimate the use of a mere 4%
              (maximum) of resources for building purposes. Activist groups will
              be able to monitor these activities
            </li>
            <li>
              Database, which accounts usage of a particular reserve is compiled
              for various companies, a point of exceeding the limit will hold
              them answerable to the people. This will prevent pollution.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tundra vegetation growing in and around the reserves will protect
              the ground because tundra vegetation grows in places with less
              water. Ground levels will be protected from degradation.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The impact of our solution, if positive will reduce pollution
            levels, animal deaths and most importantly save the resources.

          <h3>What Will Our Next Step be? For the future.</h3>
          <p>
            As we know, a lot of people will be unemployed at the end of this
            operation. So what are the methods we might use?<br />
            The extra materials found in the forest like fallen leaves,
            branches, barks may be used to make new materials.<br />
            Places which are completely unusable may be subjected to Jhum
            cultivation and people may work on these plantation.<br />
            As a conclusion, we might only be able hope that our initiative is a
            success. And we can protect the resources. But unless people
            understand the evils we are dealing with here, we won’t be able to
            change. So, the basic changes must start with our immediate
            awareness. We must raise these issues for the future generations to
            come.<br />
            Nature is an art of God. How pathetic are we to ruin that art. Only
            time will tell us, what us our prupose.
