            Imagine being a human, and facing the problems of the society.<br />
            Being able to voice our concern over them is a boon, exclusive to
            us. If the animals could talk, they would have the most
            heart-warming tale to tell.<br />
            The term over- exploitation refers to the state of using a
            particular resource the point of diminishing and destroying it.<br />
            Overexploitation has led to a point where we are witnessing the last
            fraction of our resources while overexploitation of our animal’s
            species is paving the way to their extension.<br />
            Poaching is the illegal hunting, killing and capturing of wild
            animals for their products such as ivory, horn, teeth, bone etc.<br />

            <li>
              Poaching can cause serious problems in society by spreading food
              borne illness and lack of natural resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hunting of animal’s leads to the disruption of circle of life.
              E.g. - We kill the ‘Rhinoceros’ for their horns. The Rhinoceros
              are important grazers, consuming large amounts of vegetation and
              shaping the landscape. This benefits other animals and keeps a
              healthy balance within the ecosystem
            </li>
            <li>
              Iconic animals are a tourist attraction. The animals, negligence
              upon whom has led to the point of them being endangered are the
              reasons the state is getting a major revenue boost. Ironically!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are hundreds of reasons, why the over explosion of animals is
            one of the most relevant problem of the society, but we are limited
            by the word capacity.

            Given How Grave is the problem, what are the existing initiatives by

            <li>
              A campaign on Saving Animals, sponsored by ITC – Classmate India,

            <li>
              Mere declaration of an area as a Sanctuary or National Park and
              negligence for the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using mega-stars like Action, Sportsmen to spread awareness.
              However, no amount of awareness could change the mind of people
              who is determined on doing something that rules out 2/3 initiative
              by the existing bodies.
            </li>

          <p>
            While we as the next generation cannot promise an absolute do-over
            and solve all problems, we can suggest initiative as intelligence.
            As such we have chosen the “Animals of the nearest accessible
            National Park” as our responsibility to whom we would provide a
            promise to protect them.

          <h3>So After Much Criticism, What Are Our Proposed Solution?</h3>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>
              To provide the best security, we must appoint good people,
              determined to save the animals. Education has always been a bench
              mark for eligibility. As such we propose to hold examination
              before appointing them. The exams based on the knowledge about
              zoology, Botany, Chemistry, Forest studies. Our Databases should
              be efficient enough to compile the results of their test and their
              location to appoint the serious bunch of committed people.
            </li>
            <li>
              We must test the pH level of their existing habitats and the rest
              of the forest and plant favorable gazing ground for the animals.
              E.g. - Elephants wouldn’t wonder about. Some is applicable for all
              animals at different levels of the Food cycle, based on the
              availability of food. After animals are eventually shifted to an
              area, security can be focused more on them.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the past, water bodies have been a major point that influence
              the animals. Most animals drown in river, while poachers use the
              pathway of water to get inside animal territories.<br />
              If an animal species, like crocodiles are introduced in water
              bodies, Poachers would be limited of their passage.<br />
              Also, Animals die in flood because they wander deeper into water
              bodies. The existence of Major species like crocodiles would limit
              there movement too.
            </li>
            <li>
              With evolving modern science, we can use gadgets like, Drones
              equipped with heat signature detection that gives us a topography
              surveillance scope of the area.
            </li>
            <li>
              GPS may be equipped in the scales of animals most valuable. Like
              Rhinos and Elephant’s. This would help us with a tighter
              surveillance. Also the animals can be selected based on their
              maturity. E.g. - Rhinos with a fully grown horn are more
              vulnerable.
            </li>

            To conclude, we can say our animals don’t have a language we
            understand to voice their concerns.<br />
            All we could do is to raise our voice to protect them because our
